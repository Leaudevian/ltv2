[INSTALLATION] 
-put [RealisticTopSpeedforFiveM] in your server resources folder
-add the line below in your server.cfg
start [RealisticTopSpeedforFiveM]

-DONE!

You can rename [Realistic Top Speed for FiveM] to whatever you want just make sure to change the name of the resource in your server.cfg 
!THESE HAVE TO BE IDENTICAL

[UPDATING]
Fivem only needs a single refernce to ONLY the vehicles being edited. This is because it loads the game files by default, and only requires the information it needs to overwrite those files. To update simply add the new edited vehicles to the handling.meta. Clear your cache and restart your server. 

*The example.meta is an example of how a handling.meta should look and contains a single vehicle.

!IT IS IMPORTANT YOU ADD ONLY THE VEHICLES YOU MADE EDITS TO. DO NOT LIST VEHICLES TWICE!

If the resource doesn't work the first thing you're going to want to do is check for syntax errors (this can be done easily in Open IV), secondly make sure your server artifacts are up to date.
